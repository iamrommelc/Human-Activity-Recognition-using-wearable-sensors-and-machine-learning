# Human-Activity-Recognition-using-wearable-sensors-and-machine-learning
A human activity recognition model is developed using accelerometer data extracted from sensors and a machine learning approach is used for multi-label activity recognition.

Human activity recognition is the problem of classifying sequences of accelerometer data recorded by specialized harnesses or smart phones into known well-defined movements.
It is a challenging problem given the large number of observations produced each second, the temporal nature of the observations, and the lack of a clear way to relate accelerometer data to known movements.
Classical approaches to the problem involve hand crafting features from the time series data based on fixed-sized windows and training machine learning models, such as ensembles of decision trees. The difficulty is that this feature engineering requires deep expertise in the field.
Here, we extract real time data from a smartphoneâ€™s accelerometer (mainly velocity changes across three axes i.e., X, Y and Z). Accordingly, 9 additional features are recorded which include the following:
1. X^2
2. Y^2
3. Z^2
4. X_fd
5. Y_fd
6. Z_fd
7. X_sd
8. Y_sd
9. Z_fd

And the activities recorded are as follows:

1. First, using third party software, raw accelerometer data is recorded from the accelerometer sensor of smartphone.
2. Using raw data, activity wise labelling is done and rows are shuffled randomly to build our dataset.
3. Unnecessary outliers are removed.
4. Further, the dataset is split into 80:20 ratio and trained on state-of-the-art classifiers and a custom made neural network.
5. On the analysis of the performance, the best performing model is selected on the basis of certain matrices and the model is used for multi-label classification.
6. The evaluation is performed and results are analysed accordingly.
